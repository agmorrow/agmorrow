Hello, I am Austin Morrow. I am a full stack developer based in Denver, CO. I am currently in a coding bootcamp focusing on full-stack web development. I have front-end development skills with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am currently working on learning and enhancing my skills in back-end development with MySQL and MongoDB. I love design! It excites me to see all the building blocks creating an application from the ground up. Let me know if you would like to connect! I can't wait to continue building new projects and meeting new people!
